# United Twinlight Souls
 United Twilight Souls is a beat-em-up game adventure where you must overcome all the corrupted enemies and free the forest from the darkness. 
 
## Usage
The Release should contain all needed files to run the game.

In order to run the game inside the Unity editor you will need:
- To ensure that Blender is installed to import some mesh files.
- To ensure that the current and only loaded scene is RootScene.

## About
This game is based on a past project towards which I contributed, Twinlight Souls.

Twinlight Souls was developed during the Master in Advanced Programming for AAA Video Games and the  Master in Animation & Digital Arts for AAA Video Games by a team composed by 21 people. The game was developed in an in-house engine also developed during the Masters.

Almost all assets and mechanics were conceived during the development of Twinlight Souls by the team.

I ported a reimagined version of that game to Unity to showcase my skills in the engine. The whole port was done by myself.
